                    I am a Wife, Mother, Navy Veteran, and a Full Stack Web Developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been working in Web Development in some way ever since I got out of the Navy in 2009.

            <p>
                When I started I self taught myself the basics of HTML and CSS, so that I could create a website to show off my kids to my family.  As the years went on I learned more on my own.  
            </p>
            <p>
                At the beginning of 2020 I started Lambda School to become a Full Stack Web Developer.  Please take a look at my current and past projects to see what I am doing and have done.
